# Security and privacy

## What the site does and does not do

- Static page plus three read-only serverless functions (`/api/sats`, `/api/launches`, `/api/weather`), and the static images of the ground round the launch sites (`/earth/`).
- No accounts, no cookies, no analytics, no tracking, no ads.
- Everything personal stays in the visitor's own browser (`localStorage`, keys `gcdatlas.*`): settings, collection log, daily streak, and the location used for *your sky*. Location is only requested when the visitor asks for *use my location*, and only a rounded latitude and longitude are kept.

## Threat model and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-site scripting | All visitor-visible text is set with `textContent`, never `innerHTML` with external data. Launch and satellite names from the APIs are length-limited on the server and inserted as text. Keep it that way. |
| Server-side request forgery | The API functions fetch fixed URLs only; nothing from the request (query, headers, body) is used to build a URL. |
| Abuse of the API functions / upstream rate limits | Responses are cached at the Vercel edge (`s-maxage` 6 h for satellites, 1 h for launches, 30 min for the weather) so upstream sees a few requests a day however much traffic arrives. The edge cache keys on the full URL, so any query string is refused with a 404 before anything is fetched (`api/_lib/guard.js`); otherwise `?x=1`, `?x=2`… would each run the function and hit the upstream. A warm function keeps its last good answer (2 h for satellites, 30 min for launches), parallel requests share one fetch, and if the upstream fails the last good answer is served. Error replies do not repeat upstream details. Optional extra: a Vercel Firewall rate limit on `/api/*`. |
| Crafted share links | Values from the URL hash are checked: object keys are looked up in `BYKEY`, which has no prototype (`#o=constructor` finds nothing), and numbers (`jd`, `deep`, camera) must be finite and are clamped. `?flags=` applies to that visit only and is never saved, so a shared link cannot change a visitor's settings for good. |
| Clickjacking | `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (see `vercel.json`). The claude.ai artifact build is a separate page. |
| MIME sniffing, referrer leaks | `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. |
| Powerful browser features | `Permissions-Policy` disables camera, microphone and payment; geolocation only for this origin, and only on request. |
| Secrets | There are none. No API keys are needed (CelesTrak, Launch Library 2 and Open-Meteo are public). If one is ever needed, put it in Vercel environment variables, read it only in `api/`, never in `src/`. |
| Supply chain | The page has zero runtime dependencies. Dev dependencies (Playwright, sharp) never ship. Tools in `tools/` run only at data-generation time. |

## Recommended next step: a Content Security Policy

Once the inline script is moved to a file (or hashed), add to `vercel.json`:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'sha256-…'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: blob:; connect-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'
```

`build.mjs` can compute the script hash at build time.

## Before adding social features

Comments, likes or listings mean storing visitor content. Plan in `docs/ROADMAP.md` → *Social*; at minimum: authentication or anonymous rate-limited tokens, server-side validation and length limits, moderation (a queue and a report button), escaping on display, a privacy note, and data deletion on request. Keep it behind the `social` flag until all of that exists.

## Reporting a problem

Open a GitHub issue. For anything sensitive, use GitHub's *Report a vulnerability* button on the repository's Security tab (private vulnerability reporting).
