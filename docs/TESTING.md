# Testing

The page is WebGL, so tests drive a real (headless) Chromium with Playwright. WebGL runs on SwiftShader (a CPU renderer): correct but slow, so frames take longer than on a real GPU and simulations advance less per second of wall time.

## Setup

```sh
npm install      # installs playwright and sharp (dev only; the site itself has no dependencies)
npx playwright install chromium   # first time only, if Playwright has no browser yet
```

## The tests

| Command | What it checks | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm test` (`tests/smoke.mjs`, then `tests/mobile.mjs`) | the page loads without errors; every object in the registry renders one frame from its first view; no NaN camera; key interface panels open; the atlas controls on a desk (all inside the panel at 90 to 160% menu text, the sort row one line for every sort, no name cut short, no heading over its note, the Solar System measured from the Sun and climbing, one kind under one heading named after it, distance from Earth with the places we are inside last, saved choices from older versions, the search across kinds, no keyboard row with nothing typed, the arrow keys reaching "all", a place seen with "not seen yet" on counted at once, every badge row doing something, a solid badge tray); then the phone checks below | 4–6 min |
| `npm run test:motion` (`tests/motion.mjs`) | the angle loop starts after picking an object and moves the camera; pause, play and space work; the flight from the edge of the universe to Earth grows Earth smoothly and lands without a jump; H flies home to Earth and pauses a tour; a free camera keeps moving with the object it left, says so, and play and the "back to" pill fly back; letting go of Jupiter does not enlarge it around the camera; W A S D stays within reach of the nearest object; riding the Halo through a fold (a wind-up of about 7 s, the ship easing off, a starburst as it goes and as it arrives) and a light-speed jump; tour trips without zoom dips; the Halo always travelling (never stopped, never turning on the spot, circling or turning faster than its tightest turn) and staying 90 to 200 s at each place with three passes or more, six hops that used to go wrong, its jobs, the scan's hologram on Jupiter's drawn surface with the Great Red Spot's bracket on the spot and nothing drawn in Sgr A*'s shadow, Pip's outings (out for most of the job, never far from the ship or in its hull, the ship waiting for it, home as embers, called home early within 1.7 s, outings that vary), weapons tests that leave nothing behind; the random tour deals 12 good places (one per place, never the Halo, at most 3 of a kind, the first never where it sets off), puts unseen places first (a seen one only when no unseen one could be dealt, or when every one would be a much rougher trip), keeps trips smooth with only 6 places left unseen (8 seeded deals: at most 6% of trips zoom out over 100,000 times and 18% over 1,000), deals new ones on every start, at the last stop (green button, ] and the end of the last angle) and from a shared link (a link to "your sky" opens the sky without the tour), deals ahead on the last stop (playing or paused) and while the list of tours is open, keeps the tour track's names in step, and three seeded random tours (one with only 6 places left unseen) played angle by angle, up to the trip into the next deal, never dip or fly through a third object. Deterministic: the same numbers on every run (part of `npm test`) | ~20 s |
| `npm run test:mobile` (`tests/mobile.mjs`) | at 390 x 844 and 844 x 390: the dock fits without overflow, the info card sits above it and expands, collapses and hides, the scale chip opens and closes the ladder, the atlas stays above the dock with every control inside it and nothing wider than its box; upright (390 x 844, 360 x 780, 375 x 667, 375 x 553, each at 90 to 160% menu text) it is one scrolling column that opens with the controls in sight and has room for seven list rows (five at 375 x 553) with a kind and "not seen yet" once they scroll away, the results line and heading staying at the top; on its side (844 x 390, 667 x 375, 90 to 160%) two panes at the default menu text with every control in its pane; everywhere no name cut short, no heading over its note, a sort row that keeps its height, no keyboard row, a solid badge tray; the badge tray and Esc; the interface fades on a tour and the first tap only wakes it (the tour keeps playing); home is the first dock button; with real two-finger touch events a pinch zooms by the finger ratio, a slide keeps the lock and Earth on screen, lifting one finger does not orbit, a double-tap on the sky and play re-centre, a pinch on the card does not zoom the page; home pauses a tour; the random tour is second and in full view in the list of tours (also on a phone on its side, where the list comes before "time at each stop"), and a tap starts it at "stop 1 / 12"; screenshots in `tests/out/mobile/` | ~2 min |
| `npm run test:music` (`tests/music.mjs`) | renders every song of the catalogue offline (45 s each, from the end of its intro): each deals the name and length the list gives, each style is within 1.5 dB of lofi seeds 1 to 3 (the average of BS.1770 loudness full range and above 200 Hz, as on a laptop speaker), each song within 3 dB, peaks under -1 dBFS at full volume; the shuffle of each mood (200 songs: only its styles, every song once a round, never twice in a row, a calm song at least every fifth in the mix); song places exist in the atlas; saved pre-0.9.2 styles map to moods. Writes a WAV of each style's first song to `tests/out/music/` | ~2 min |
| `npm test` (`tests/smoke.mjs`, then `tests/mobile.mjs`) | the page loads without errors; every object in the registry renders one frame from its first view; no NaN camera; key interface panels open; then the phone checks below | 4–6 min |
| `npm run test:wallpaper` (`tests/wallpaper.mjs`) | wallpaper mode (`?wallpaper=1`): checks embedded screensaver start, tour playback, input swallowing, sound/network silencing, dynamic FPS changes, freeze/unfreeze state, lap reshuffle, and normal saver regression (part of `npm test`) | ~30 s |
| `npm run test:motion` (`tests/motion.mjs`) | the angle loop starts after picking an object and moves the camera; pause, play and space work; the flight from the edge of the universe to Earth grows Earth smoothly and lands without a jump; H flies home to Earth and pauses a tour; a free camera keeps moving with the object it left, says so, and play and the "back to" pill fly back; letting go of Jupiter does not enlarge it around the camera; W A S D stays within reach of the nearest object (part of `npm test`) | ~1 min |
| `npm run test:mobile` (`tests/mobile.mjs`) | at 390 x 844 and 844 x 390: the dock fits without overflow, the info card sits above it and expands, collapses and hides, the scale chip opens and closes the ladder, the atlas stays above the dock, the interface fades on a tour and the first tap only wakes it (the tour keeps playing); home is the first dock button; with real two-finger touch events a pinch zooms by the finger ratio, a slide keeps the lock and Earth on screen, lifting one finger does not orbit, a double-tap on the sky and play re-centre, a pinch on the card does not zoom the page; home pauses a tour; screenshots in `tests/out/mobile/` | ~2 min |
| `npm run test:tour` (`tests/tour.mjs`) | plays the grand tour for 1,000 simulated seconds, then locks on, zooms, orbits and flies freely; reports any error or NaN | 5–8 min |
| `npm run shots -- sun:0,ton618:1` (`tests/shots.mjs`) | screenshots of objects at given view indices into `tests/out/`, plus a contact sheet `tests/out/sheet.png` | ~10 s each |
| `npm run shots -- --phone earth:0` | the same at a 390 x 844 phone viewport | |
| `npm run showcase:video` (`tools/showcase-video.mjs`) | records the Halo showcase (`?showcase=halo`: all angles, then every job, light speed and a fold) to `tests/out/halo-showcase.webm`, frame by frame on the GPU, for reviewing changes to the ship. `--url="..."` adds to the page's address; `--from=26 --dur=30` records only that stretch (the part before runs unrecorded, frame by frame as usual); `--phone` records a phone (390 x 844, touch); `--w`, `--h`, `--kbps` | ~3 min |
| `npm run catalog` (`tools/catalog.mjs`) | not a test: regenerates `docs/CATALOG.md` from the built page | 30 s |

## Test hooks

The page exposes `window.__cosmos` (read the bottom of `src/09-render.js`, `09f-features.js`, `09g-sky.js`):

- `view(key, index)`: jump straight to an object's view (no flight).
- `simulate(seconds)`: advance the whole simulation deterministically at 30 steps per second.
- `setMove(obj, view, fraction)`: freeze a flyby at a point, for screenshots.
- `tick(dt)`: one step of the simulation; `land()`: finish a flight; `setDays(d)`: the Solar System clock, in days from the page's start (the planets move there on the next step).
- `BYKEY.halo.dbg`: the Halo. `reset(seed, key)` starts its route afresh at `key` with dice of its own, the same route every time; `force({ target, act, travel })` decides its next stop, job or way of travel; `replan()`, `skip()`; `act`, `tau`, `beams`, `FX` to read what it is doing.
- `setOpt(key, value, quiet)`, `SET`, `FLAGS`: settings and flags.
- `startSaver()`, `startPhoto()`, `enterSky()`, `openStory()`, `setStory(0..1000)`.

Set `window.__syncCompile = true` in an init script to compile shaders synchronously (otherwise objects show as dots for their first frames), and `window.__noAdapt = true` to stop the automatic quality reduction on slow (software) rendering.

## Tests that give the same result every run

A check that passes on one run and fails on the next is worth nothing, so a test that steps the simulation should fix everything that changes between runs. `tests/motion.mjs` does this:

- `openPage({ now })` fixes the page's date and time, so the Solar System starts in the same place.
- `openPage({ freeze:true })` (`window.__freeze`) stops the page's own animation loop from moving anything. Otherwise it keeps running between two `page.evaluate` calls with frames of real, machine-dependent length, and the next check starts from a different state.
- The Halo draws its choices from dice a test can seed: `BYKEY.halo.dbg.reset(seed)`. Its route then depends only on the seed, the clock and the camera, not on what ran before it.

Its Halo checks fly route 1. `HALO_SEED=n node tests/motion.mjs` flies route `n` instead, the same one every time: use it to replay a route that broke a check, or to try many routes.

## Writing a new test

Copy `tests/smoke.mjs`: use `tests/lib.mjs` → `openPage()`, do things through `page.evaluate` and the hooks, collect `pageerror` and console errors, exit non-zero on failure. Prefer checking state (`__cosmos.orbit.lock`, a readout text) over pixels; use screenshots for anything visual and look at them.

## Manual checks before merging visual work

- Desktop Chrome and one of Safari or Firefox.
- A phone (or `npm run test:mobile` and its screenshots): the dock, the info card (more, less, hide, swipe), the scale chip, panels, idle fade. Try it upright and on its side. Gestures need a real iPhone and a real Android phone: pinch, a two-finger slide, lifting one finger, a double-tap on the sky, and a pinch on the card (the page must not zoom).
- Reduced motion (OS setting): no flashes, tours still work.
- Sound on and off; the first click starts music.
