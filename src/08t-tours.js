// with only a few unseen places left, the tour reaches them through places seen before, not by zooming out to the whole universe and back
// for each one). Among those, each next stop is picked at random, but less often when the trip there pulls the view far back and
// closes in again (back: the widest view on the way against the wider end, x0.03 past 100,000 times, x0.1 past 10,000, x0.3 past 1,000,
// x0.6 past 100; and x0.2 more for a trip over the galactic pole, isScenic, the rule of startFlight), and less often when it would be a
// third place of one kind in a row (x0.4). No place twice (see samePlace), at most 3 from one atlas category, never the place it sets off
// from as the first stop, and no trip that would fly through a third object (tripClear).
