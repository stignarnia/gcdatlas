// ================================================================ Pip, the Halo's little drone (made up, like the ship): a round cartoon pod about 150 m across, a
// thirtieth of the ship's length, with two big eyes. It lives in the belly bay. On a probe job (ACT.probe in 07h-halo.js) it streams out of
// the bay as embers, takes shape beside the ship and potters about it for half a minute, never more than about 2 ship radii away and never
// touching the hull: two or three of its four outings (a hull check and polish, engines and repairs, photos and a wave, play), in an order,
// on paths and with timings of their own, with a launch and a way home that vary too. Its eyes show how it feels about what it does (FACES).
// Then it breaks up into embers that stream back into the bay. The job waits for it (done()), so the ship never leaves while it is out. It is
// a small volume of its own (FS_DRONE), drawn right after the ship (ship.drawAfter) so the hull never covers it by mistake, and hidden
// wherever the hull or the body is in front of it (volumes have no depth test). Far away it is a steady ice-blue glint. Its controller is
// drone.ctl, run once a tick after the camera has moved (AFTER_CAM), on the job's own clock; its dice come from lcg, never hrnd, so the
// Halo's route stays the same. This file must load after 07h-halo.js (it uses S_, HULL, ACT and the hull's outline).
